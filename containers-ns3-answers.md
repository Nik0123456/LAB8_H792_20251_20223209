# Containers and NS-3 Simulator Questions and Answers

## Introduction
In the modern computing landscape, containers and virtualization play a crucial role in application deployment and resource management. The NS-3 simulator is a widely used tool for network research, providing a flexible and extensible platform for simulating various network scenarios.

## Containers
### What are Containers?
Containers are lightweight, portable units that encapsulate an application and its dependencies. They share the host system's kernel but run in isolated user spaces.

### Benefits of Using Containers
- **Portability**: Applications can run consistently across different environments.
- **Efficiency**: Containers are resource-efficient compared to traditional virtual machines.
- **Scalability**: Containers can be easily scaled up or down based on demand.

### Popular Containerization Technologies
- **Docker**: A platform that simplifies the process of building, running, and sharing containers.
- **Kubernetes**: An orchestration tool for managing containerized applications across clusters.

## Virtualization
### What is Virtualization?
Virtualization is the creation of virtual versions of computing resources, such as servers, storage devices, and networks. It allows multiple virtual environments to run on a single physical machine.

### Differences Between Virtualization and Containerization
- **Isolation**: Virtual machines (VMs) run on separate operating systems, while containers share the host OS kernel.
- **Overhead**: VMs have higher overhead due to the complete OS, whereas containers are lightweight.

### Use Cases for Virtualization
- Server consolidation
- Development and testing environments
- Disaster recovery solutions

## NS-3 Simulator
### What is NS-3?
